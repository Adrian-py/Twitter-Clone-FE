**Twitter Clone Front-End Project**
This project is a front end project I created to improve and refine my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are 3 pages(More might be added) in the website (Home page, Profile page and Search Page).

_Technologies Used_
For this project, I used vanilla CSS and Javascript so that I can improve my knowledge in the basics of Front-end first before diving into more difficult technologies

_Plans for the future_
In future projects, I plan to use more complex and advanced technologies, such as SASS, Svelte, React, Bootstrap and Vue. I am also planning to learn more about management in the intial stages of a project i.e. project management, design best practices, user flow, etc.

_Stages of development for this project_

1. Research
   In this stage, I looked through similar products of Twitter and also the main website of Twitter itself. I tried to pick best features from each source I find, and tried to imagine all those features together in a singel site. I looked for good colors, fonts and elements that could be used in the project.

2. Designing
   For designing the website, I used Figma to make the user interface of the website.

3. Coding
   As mentioned before, for this project I used vanilla CSS and Javascript to create the website. Through the coding process I ran into several problems regarding certain areas of the website, but eventually after searching through Google and viewing several stackoverflow posts, I managed to solve those problems.

This project is my first ever official project, through this project I have learned a lot of new things and refined my knowledge on basic Front end techonolgies i.e. HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My hopes are after doing this project I can improve even more and discover and learn new tecnologies that I can use for future projects.
